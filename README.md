# Apex server crasher
Crash any apex server, as long as it has > 35 players

Can't wait to see all the streamers get pissy because 
"muh cant play gamez!"

### How it works
Makes each player send a packet that stresses out the server greatly, causing the server to
make multiple large calculations eventually bringing it to its knees.

### Example in python
```python
# Simple lagger concept: how this code could be used

while 1:
   sendpkt() # Send special packet
   sleep(x)
```
